title: "How Transitions into Marriage and Parenthood Shape Individual Gender Role Attitudes: Evidence from Egypt (With Kajari Saha and Shraddha Yadav)"
excerpt: "*Abstract*: Despite progress towards a more gender equal society, substantial gender-based
disparities persist in the division of paid and unpaid work, often unpinned by deeply
rooted attitudes surrounding gender appropriate roles in work and family life. Therefore,
understanding how gender role attitudes form is crucial for addressing persistent
gender-based disparities in the labor market and beyond. Using longitudinal
data from Egypt, this study examines how key life-events such as marriage and parenthood
shape the gender role attitudes of men and women. We find that marriage
leads to a significant shift towards more conservative attitudes among women, with
no comparable shift observed after parenthood. For men, no statistically significant
change is observed after transition to either marriage or parenthood. Notably, the
observed shift towards more conservative attitudes among women is driven primarily
by women who were relatively more progressive before marriage. Additionally,
we find that the absolute distance between the gender role attitude index of women
and their husbands declines post marriage, suggesting that women may adjust their
views to align more closely with a new, gendered marital identity."
