*Abstract*: In patriarchal societies, social norms restrict women’s roles within households to
only certain spheres of household decision-making. This leads to asymmetric information
about household resources between spouses, making coordination in decisionmaking
difficult. Poor coordination in risk-taking decisions can expose households to
excessive risk if a person makes risky decisions under the false impression that their
spouse has sufficient assets to cover a crisis or it can cause households to sacrifice legitimate
investment opportunities if both spouses are overly conservative. This study
investigates whether married couples in rural Bangladesh successfully coordinate risky
decisions across their respective domains. Using an artefactual experiment, we elicit
individual risk preferences and employ a two-stage lottery-choice game to examine joint
decision-making. The results indicate widespread coordination failures: only a quarter
of couples successfully coordinate risk-taking decisions, while most either assume excessive
risk or become overly conservative due to misaligned beliefs about each other’s
choices. Households where spouses exhibit greater divergence in individual risk preferences
are more prone to coordination errors, as spouses try to counteract each other’s
choice. These experimental findings align with real-world financial behaviors, as women
who overestimated their husband’s risk aversion in the experiment also tended to overestimate
their husband’s actual savings behavior. This study provides novel evidence
on how intrahousehold information frictions contribute to inefficient risk-sharing and
distort critical financial decisions, potentially affecting long-term household welfare.
The findings contribute to research on strategic interactions in household decisionmaking,
risk-sharing inefficiencies, and the role of gender norms in shaping financial
coordination within families.
