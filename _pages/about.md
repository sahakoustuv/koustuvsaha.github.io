Applied economist studying development and gender using field and quasi-experimental evidence.

Hi! I’m an applied economist specializing in international development and gender economics. My research uses field experiments and quasi-experimental methods to study household risk-taking, agricultural labor markets, farm productivity, and gender norms.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the American University of Sharjah (AUS). We are running a choice experiment with herders in rural India to quantify the trade-off between traditional beliefs about predators and livelihood losses from livestock predation.

I earned my Ph.D. in Agricultural Economics from Purdue University (July 2025). My job-market paper examined strategic interactions and coordination failure in spouses’ risk-taking in rural Bangladesh. Another essay investigates whether targeted public policy can offset gendered labor displacement associated with structural transformation.

A joint paper with Kajal Gulati and Travis Lybbert received the Uma Lele Prize for Best Contributed Paper in Gender (ICAE 2024); it documents productivity differences among rice-producing households associated with the use of hired versus family female labor.
